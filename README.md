I am a huge fan of Unsplash, so this project has been so much fun!

I have built a replica of Unspash's core functionality. I chose to build Unsplash with React and Typescript, allowing me to really deep dive into these languages more and become alot more confident with them. For styling I used Tailwind, the more I use Tailwind the more of a fan I become. 

What I really got out of this project was -

. A deeper understanding of React - UseContext has been a blessing for state management and cancelling out unneccessary prop drilling

. Typescript has really helped me slow down and understand the TYPE of value I am expecting to recieve or pass around my code. I will forever keep using this syntactic superset of JavaScript.

. JEST  A deeper understanding of testing and how important it is to test my code before build.

. Manipulation of an API endpoint to get back exactly what I want from the unsplash API

. Furthering my knowledge of React-Routing - creating a dynamic page and a 404 No Page Found 

. Implementing Image placeholders 

My Biggest challenge with this project was figuring out how to implement the masonry grid layout that Unsplash use to showcase their images.
